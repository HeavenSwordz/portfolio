# Portfolio

Small project to simply display my portfolio and have a reason to use [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run generate
```

It generates a static site that can be deployed on any hosting service.
